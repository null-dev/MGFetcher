# MangaToEPUB
A tiny, lightweight java program to fetch manga easily!
<br>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> This program was made for my personal use so do not expect a lot of support or updates...

## About ##
MGFetcher downloads manga from MangaHere.co and saves it as image files and packs every chapter into an individual .epub file.

## How To Use ##
Double click on the .JAR file. Go to mangahere.co and click on the manga you want to download. At the chapter selection page, copy the URL and paste it into the "URL" text box in MGFetcher (EX: ```http//www.mangahere.co/manga/YOUR MANGA HERE/```). Then just click "Go". Your manga will be downloaded into a folder named "downloads" in the same folder as where MGFetcher is placed.
